Secure user registration, login, and personalized profile dashboard with progress tracking.

✅ AI-Powered Mock Interviews

Real-time mock interviews using AI for technical and behavioral questions.

Voice/text-based interview simulation with instant feedback and scoring.

Question difficulty adapts based on user performance.

✅ Plagiarism & Grammar Checking with NLP

For blog posts or written answers, built-in NLP model checks for grammar, plagiarism, and relevance to the topic.

Works especially well in blog or answer submission sections.

✅ Coding Challenges & Problem Solving

Includes a library of DSA and system design questions.

Users can solve problems and get AI-assisted hints and code reviews.

✅ Community Q&A and Peer Review

Forum for discussion, solution sharing, and peer feedback.

Upvote/downvote and comment system to boost active participation.

✅ Live Coding Contests & Ranking System

Regular contests with time-bound challenges.

Tiered ranking system with badges and rewards to encourage competition.

✅ Learning Path & Certifications

Course-style roadmap with structured topics (DSA, OOP, System Design).

Certificates issued upon completion of each track.

✅ Real-Time Notifications and WebSocket Integration

WebSocket-based notification system for contest alerts, feedback, and community interactions.
